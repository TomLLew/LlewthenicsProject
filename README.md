# Personal Workout Log
## Project Brief

To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.

### My Solution

I decided to build a Workout Log application where users can create their workouts, allowing them to keep track of their workouts. It will also allow my users to update and delete their workout logs.
Users will be able to register an account, allowing them to just see their own workouts in the log.

## The future
Many things can be added, for the future. 
I would like to add a feature where there is a library of workouts that the user can use, which will allow the ability to give recommendations to the user, helping them decide on a workout to do. maybe the ability to filter out workouts by body type. 
Another feature could be comparing your own workouts against the workouts of other users, allowing the user to track their progress against another user.
